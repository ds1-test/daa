Great! Since you said “Yes,” I’ll continue with next advanced steps you can add to your CattleGuard system for improved usability and power.

Phase 8: Advanced Features & Enhancements for CattleGuard


---

1. Background Data Sync & Offline-First Reliability

Use React Native Background Fetch or Expo Task Manager to sync data when network is available automatically.

This ensures your mobile app updates cattle data without manual refresh.


Example packages:

expo install expo-task-manager expo-background-fetch

You can create a background task that periodically fetches backend data and updates local SQLite.


---

2. Local Push Notifications

Alert farmers immediately on the phone when anomalies are detected.


Example:

expo install expo-notifications

Basic usage:

import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "CattleGuard Alert!",
    body: "Cattle COW001 is showing abnormal health data!",
  },
  trigger: null, // immediately
});


---

3. Add Authentication & Role Management

Secure your backend API and mobile app.

Farmers can login to see only their cattle.

Use JWT tokens with Flask and React Native AsyncStorage to store tokens.



---

4. Enhanced AI Model Integration

Use TensorFlow Lite models directly inside the mobile app with tflite-react-native to run anomaly detection on device.

This simulates true edge AI on phone.


Install:

npm install tflite-react-native

Prepare your TensorFlow Lite model and load it inside React Native.


---

5. Geofencing & Lost Cattle Alert

Use GPS geofencing to alert when cattle move outside predefined zones.

React Native libraries like react-native-background-geolocation can help track cattle movement.



---

6. Data Visualization in Mobile

Use chart libraries like Victory Native or React Native Chart Kit for in-app trend charts of vitals.


Example install:

npm install victory-native react-native-svg


---

7. Offline Map Tiles

Use offline map tile caching so maps work fully offline.

Libraries like react-native-maps support offline tiles with extra setup.



---

8. Automated Deployment

Use Docker Compose to deploy backend API easily.

Use Expo Application Services (EAS) to build and deploy the mobile app to Play Store/App Store.
