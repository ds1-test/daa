Awesome! Moving on to the next phase: Deployment and Packaging so you can run your entire CattleGuard system smoothly and share it with farmers or testers.

Phase 9: Deployment & Packaging — Step-by-Step


---

1. Dockerize Backend & AI Services

You likely already have Docker for simulating edge AI, but now we’ll make your Flask API fully dockerized for easy deployment.

Dockerfile example for Flask backend:

# Use official Python image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy all code
COPY . .

# Expose port 5000
EXPOSE 5000

# Run Flask app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

requirements.txt example:

Flask
tensorflow
scikit-learn
twilio
flask-cors
sqlite3


---

2. Docker Compose

Create docker-compose.yml to run your backend and simulate edge device:

version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development

Run with:

docker-compose up --build


---

3. React Dashboard Build

In your React dashboard project folder:

npm run build

This creates a production-ready build folder.

You can serve this with nginx or any static web server.

Basic nginx config to serve React app:

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name your_domain_or_ip;

  location / {
    root /path/to/your/react/build;
    index index.html index.htm;
    try_files $uri /index.html;
  }

  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/api/;
  }
}


---

4. Mobile App: Build & Publish

You have an Expo app — now build the standalone apps:

Install Expo CLI if not installed:


npm install -g expo-cli

Build Android APK:


expo build:android

Build iOS app (macOS required):


expo build:ios

After build, follow Expo instructions to download APK or publish to Play Store/App Store.


---

5. Testing & Final Checks

Run backend containers and confirm API endpoints work.

Open React dashboard in browser and confirm data and alerts.

Test mobile app offline and online data sync.

Test SMS and email alert triggers.

Test cattle search and map functionality on mobile.



---

6. Optional: Cloud Deployment

You can deploy backend on AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Heroku, or similar platforms.

Use managed PostgreSQL or keep SQLite for small scale.
